# GYM-DATABASE

By Rohan Sharma (https://github.com/Rohan392), Malcolm Todd () and Raheem Mir(
A gym database was created with the idea that a person 'A' is opening a new gym. This person would require a database system that manages gym memberships, employee information, and classes. This database will track information on persons, members, employees, and classes, including times and spaces available for classes.
