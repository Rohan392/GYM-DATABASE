Project Overview
**GYM-DATABASE** is a relational database system designed to support the operations of a newly established gym. The system is intended for use by an individual or organization launching a fitness center and requires robust tools for managing key aspects of day-to-day business activities.

The database provides functionality to:
- Track person records, including both members and employees

- Manage gym memberships, including registration and status

- Store and organize employee information, such as roles and responsibilities

- Schedule and monitor fitness classes, including available times, assigned instructors, and room availability

 By structuring the data efficiently, the system supports streamlined operations, improves data accuracy, and facilitates administrative decision-making.

This project demonstrates our understanding of database design principles, including normalization, entity-relationship modeling, and SQL query development.
