# GYM-DATABASE

By Rohan Sharma, Malcolm Todd (https://github.com/Rubixue) and Raheem Mir(https://github.com/raheemmir).   
A gym database was created with the idea that a person 'A' is opening a new gym. This person would require a database system that manages gym memberships, employee information, and classes. This database will track information on persons, members, employees, and classes, including times and spaces available for classes.
